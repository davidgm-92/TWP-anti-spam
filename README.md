# The Wild Project's Anti-SPAM

This simple browser extension removes the SPAM videos from 'The wild project' channel in your Youtube subscription feed.

Any video from that channel with a length lower than an hour is targeted as a clip from the long and important videos, meaning it is a video with just spam purposes and so, it is removed from your subscription feed.

Note that the videos are not removed from any other sections or searching, just from your subscriptions feed.
